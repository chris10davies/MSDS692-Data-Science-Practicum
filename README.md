# Indeed Company Review Analysis (Google & Tesla)
#### MSDS692 Data Science Practicum 1

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
Unemployment being the lowest it's been in 50 years is just one of the reasons companies are having a hard time filling jobs and attracting top talent (NPR, 2018). The goal of this project is to utilize company reviews web-scraped from Indeed to gain insight on what indicators impact employee satisfaction, and in turn, organizational culture and recruiting. The analysis for this project focuses on Google and Tesla reviews.  

The techniques in my analysis mostly focus on

The dataset will be company review data scraped from Indeed for Google and Tesla.  I also plan to do sentiment analysis and use machine learning to predict sentiment and/or review ratings (1-5 stars).  As part of the exploratory data analysis (EDA),  I will also include times series analysis using the review date and geospatial analysis using the review location.
